## Problem Statement

The sponsor wanted us to do some molecular descriptor analysis to reduce the time and cost of drug discovery. By building machine learning models to predict the bioactivity of the potential drug-like compounds and establish a new pipeline to rank potential drug compounds, we can lessen the costs of drug development assays. For deployment, sponsors required us a user-friendly platform for scientists/specialists with none-professional data backgrounds to handily utilize the classifiers and make judgments for further drug development steps.
