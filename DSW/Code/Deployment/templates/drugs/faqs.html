                What are the targets that are shown in the section?
            </strong><br>
                There are four targets EGFR, IGF1R, MIA-PaCa, mTOR which are used to
                identify the probability for a compoundâ€™s active/inactive nature.

        <li>
            <strong>
                Can multiple targets be selected at the same time?
            </strong><br>
                Yes, they can be selected.

                What is the reason for using two different types of classification for obtaining the results?
            </strong><br>
                To get accurate results and for comparison purposes, we have used two ways of classification.

            <strong>
                Why is it taking so long to get the results?
            </strong><br>
                Normally for a small list of compounds, it takes around 1 minute to generate results as
                the model is running in the background. In case you have uploaded as input a file that has
                 many compounds, it might be delayed to produce the results.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Can the results be produced for large amounts of data?
            </strong><br>
            Yes, you can enter your email address where the results would be received after the model
            is done running in the background.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>
                What is the correct format for uploading the input file?
            </strong><br>
            A list of only the compounds as a csv format. You can find an example input file next
            to the choose file button.
        </li><br>

            <strong>
                What if I do not want to enter my email address ?
            </strong><br>
            Entering an email address is optional. If you want to receive the results in your mail,
            it should be entered otherwise you can view the results directly.
